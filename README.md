# Pattern Recognition Course's Teaching Assistant
In the Fall of 2022 and Fall of 2023, I was the teaching assistant for the Pattern Recognition course held at **[Amirkabir University of Technology(AUT)](https://aut.ac.ir/en)** by **[Prof. Rahmati](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EYk7M80AAAAJ&hl=en)**. My responsibilities included designing the questions for homeworks and grading. Also, the Language of Homeworks is **English**.
